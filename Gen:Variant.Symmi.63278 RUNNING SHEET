Malware No 1 Running Sheet
Actions taken to conduct analysis

-Identification
Firstly I have used wxHexEditor to delete the protective line of hex code. Then I installed and used detect it easy to determine if the malware is packed or not. After that I found out that the malware was not packed I run it on virus total for identification. I have determined that the malware is an variant symmi malware and it is compiled with Microsoft Visual C/C++(6.0).

-Initial Examination
Virus total did not give me any significant information about the malware details so I switched to malwr for sandbox analysis. Based on malwr I found out a few files and registry files that it tried to tampered with. On the behavioural analysis area it shows a trend of how the malwr functions and lastly on the network analysis it shows me a domain webpage and and ip address but no attempt connection to it.

-Dynamic Analysis
With Dynamic Analysis, I used x32DBG to analyse the malware activities. Firstly used the references section to pin point a few breakpoints , found a few interesting commands and after that I used the symbol section to observe more of the malware behaviour and found a couple really interesting API. Besides that have also try to use the log tab for analysis but it did not show any noteworthy items.
